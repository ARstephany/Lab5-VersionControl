# Lab5-VersionControl
This Python script shows a simple use of a function. 
At the first comment is where I define the first function. I called it simpleFunction. 
When called, the code stops running and ends with a printed sentence saying goodbye. 
The code itself dislays an amusing interaction with the users input.
The variable "yourWish" is used to fill the users input into the final printed string.
The function "simpleFunction()" is called, ending the program with a goodbye.
